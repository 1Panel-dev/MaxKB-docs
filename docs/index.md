## 1 Introduction

!!! Abstract ""

    The rise of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) marks a new development stage in the information technology industry, opening up immense possibilities for social progress and economic development. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technology empowers Large Language Models (LLM) by integrating rich information from internal knowledge bases, bringing revolutionary improvements to generative AI. When generating answers or content, RAG technology can reference precise knowledge sources to provide highly reasonable and accurate responses to users.

!!! Abstract ""

    The integration of RAG technology with LLM models successfully addresses the limitations of LLM models when processing domain-specific requests, such as hallucinations, knowledge generalization, and poor interpretability. Knowledge base applications based on LLM and RAG technologies can help enterprises enhance their knowledge management and service capabilities, improve work efficiency, and achieve business quality and effectiveness optimization.

!!! Abstract ""

    MaxKB (Max Knowledge Base) is an open-source knowledge base question-answering system built on Large Language Models and RAG technology, widely deployed in scenarios such as intelligent customer service, enterprise knowledge bases, academic research, and education. As a software product focused on knowledge base Q&A scenarios, MaxKB injects new momentum into enterprise intelligence processes, helping organizations achieve their goals of "quality improvement and efficiency enhancement." In terms of knowledge base management, MaxKB helps enterprises achieve end-to-end automation of knowledge collection, ingestion, and knowledge base construction. For scenario-based intelligent search, MaxKB can parse user input queries and match them with relevant knowledge base content. Regarding response accuracy, MaxKB employs mature LLM + RAG technology to minimize the impact of model hallucinations on knowledge search accuracy, improving enterprises' ability to classify and retrieve business data. On the security front, MaxKB supports local deployment and local model integration, effectively controlling risks of unauthorized access when enterprises use knowledge bases, as well as potential security vulnerabilities in data transmission with public models. With MaxKB, enterprise users can rapidly deploy business AI assistants, applying generative AI capabilities to business data management, internal information queries, online customer service, and other domains, optimizing business service processes and tangibly enhancing user experience.
